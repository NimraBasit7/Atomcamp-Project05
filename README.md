The objective of this assignment is to design, train, and optimize a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to accurately classify data points in a complex 3-class spiral dataset.

The spiral pattern introduces non-linear and intertwined class boundaries, making it a challenging classification task.

To address this, careful selection of model architecture and hyperparameters is required to ensure high performance and generalization despite the presence of noise and intricate decision regions.
